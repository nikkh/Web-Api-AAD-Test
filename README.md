 # Web-Api-AAD-Test

Someone asked about securing a webapi with Azure Active Directory. In this case, they wanted application authentication.

As I was explaining it I realised I hadn't actually done this myself so I resolved to try it out.

Everything you need to try this out should be on this site. [There are basic intstructions on the wiki](https://github.com/nikkh/Web-Api-AAD-Test/wiki).
